                <p>
                    Hello everyone! My name is Danielle Raine, and
                    I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas. Pardon the state of the website! I'm still working on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics!
                    Outside of school, I'm a Break Through Tech Fellow @ Cornell working with <a href="https://mila.quebec/en">Mila</a> and three other fellows on a Machine Learning model that predicts bird species encounter rates to monitor biodiversity in the era of climate change. 
                    The work is challenging, and I'm excited to see where it takes me!
                    Anyways, I hope you enjoy your stay on my website!
                </p>

                    <dd>
                        Queried the Google Books API for ~1400 book entries with Requests in Python, storing each book's properties into a MariaDB table.
                        Multiple plots depicting book summary statistics with data from the database were created with R.
                        Evaluated and presented findings to show knowledge gained throughout the mentorship.

                    <dd>
                        Created a word count program in MIPS assembly that reads a file and records unique words, how many times they occur, and what line numbers they appear on in an ASCIIbetically sorted linked list and prints the result.

                        Built a theater ticket management backend that utilizes a hashmap to store
                        user information that users can log into, reserve, and manage seats in
                        auditoriums represented with linked lists.
                        Data is saved to text files. Written in C++.
