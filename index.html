                <p>
                    Hello everyone! My name is Danielle Raine, and
                    I am an undergrad at UT Dallas studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
                    I am passionate about learning new things in and out of my field while bringing positivity and total effort to my work and play!
                    Pardon the state of the website! I'm still working on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                        I often dig deeper to learn why certain things work the way they do. To me, understanding a topic requires analyzing all of its moving parts, seen and unseen.
                        I love using the knowledge that I find to help my peers and work on fun projects!                        
                        I am looking for internship/research opportunities in mathematics, machine learning, software development, data science, and game development.
                        My goal is to explore the cutting edge of technology as a researcher to help everyone live the life that makes them happy.
                        ...that sounds very clich√©.
                        Remember to stay safe, make logical decisions, and drink a lot of water!
