                <p>
                    Hello everyone! My name is Danielle Raine, and
                    I'm a second-year student at the University of Texas at Dallas. Pardon the state of the website! I'm still working on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics!
                    Outside of school, I'm currently a Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ Cornell in the Spring 2024 virtual cohort. 
                    The work is challenging, but learning generally is, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.
                    Anyways, I hope you enjoy your stay on my website!
                </p>

                        Queried the Google Books API for ~1400 book entries with Requests in Python,
                        storing each book's properties into a MariaDB table.
                        With R, created multiple plots depicting book summary statistics
                        with data from the database.<br>

                        Wrote a word count program in MIPS assembly that reads a file and records unique words,
                        how many times they occur, and what lines they occur on in an
                        ASCIIbetically sorted linked list and prints the result.

                    <dd>
                        Built a theater ticket management system that utilizes a hashmap to store
                        user information that users can log into, reserve, and manage seats in
                        auditoriums represented with linked lists.
                        Data is saved to text files. Written in C++.
